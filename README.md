#dirp#

Dirp is a PHP5 framework that makes dealing with files and directories
a breeze. Developed as a response to the poorly-written one-off directory
listing scripts available, Dirp strives to be a modern, efficient, extensible
and developer-friendly solution.

##Features:##

* Full-stack MVC-style framework, properly namespaced.
* Routes and parameters, with support for route passing and halting.
* Extensible with Addons, making use of a powerful but streamlined event/listener pattern.
* Clean and modern developer-friendly PHP5 code.
